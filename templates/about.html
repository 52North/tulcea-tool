          The EU funded project "Creating Interfaces" has the goal to build capacity for integrated governance at the Food-Water-Energy-nexus in cities on the water. The city of Tulcea is participating as a case study site.
          On this website, citizens in and around Tulcea can help understanding the Food-Water-Energy-nexus by submitting data about one of the following three complexes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Local producers</li>
          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Consumer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Moreover, citizens can find information about these complexes which might help in their daily decisions, e.g. where to buy healthy and local food.
          If you need assistance in using the website, see the instruction window on the map of the home page for a step by step guide or navigate to the "Guide"-section for a general overview of the tool.
          Of course, you can also contact the project team via ... <br>
